                <h2> Dexter J. Artigo </h2>
                <p> Hello and good day! My name is Dexter J. Artigo from BSMA-1C. I live in Phase 5 of Minuyan proper. I have one brother who is the eldest among us and two older sisters; I'm the youngest among them. My birthday is March 18, 2005, so I'm a Pisces. According to Kelly (2023), “Pisces is a water sign, and it is the last constellation of the zodiac. As the final sign, Pisces has absorbed every lesson—the joys and the pains, the hopes and the fears—learned by all of the other signs.” Wow, I didn't know that Pisces is the last zodiac sign until today, and I think pain and fear are the only things that I absorb from the other signs. Just kidding. Anyhow, I studied elementary at Goldenville Elementary School, Minuyan (Goldenville) National High School at high school, of course, and J.C. Excellent Christian Academic Inc. at senior high school, and now I am currently studying at the City College of San Jose Del Monte Bulacan.</p>

                <p> Basketball is my favourite sport. My father taught me to play basketball at a young age, and I enjoy it as a way for us to bond. In addition, I enjoy playing table tennis. I'm interested in liquors because I worked at a bar in BGC Taguig for the past few months, and that's how I became interested in liquors. I also enjoy math; I have competed and represented my school at Mtap since elementary school. Unfortunately, I've always been a participant; I only became a placer when I was in grade 2, but I still enjoy maths. That, I believe, is all about myself. Have a pleasant day. </p>
