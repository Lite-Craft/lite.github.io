                <h2> Fun Advancements in Technology </h2>
                <p> We will be acquainted with the history of computers and information technology. The benefits of technology are all around us and can be seen in everything from electricity to global communications. Our cars and cell phones have navigation systems to ensure that we do not get lost. We can pay our bills at the touch of a button on the internet. Our cellphones have evolved into finy little computers in our pockets. We can now communicate with anyone, anywhere in the world at any time not only by telephone, but also by video conference, instant messenger and email. With faster internet connections being introduced on a daily basis it seems like the only limit to what technology can do is our own imagination. All of these innovations have one goal in mind to make our lives easier! Technology, globalization, and innovations are really awesome and interesting! And for us to learn more, we have some lessons to read just for you! Enjoy reading and learning, pals! </p>

                  <p> The first counting device was used by the primitive people. They used sticks, stones and bones as counting tools. As human mind and technology improved with time more computing devices were developed. Some of the popular computing devices starting with the first to recent ones are described below; The history of computer begins with the birth of abacus which is believed to be the first computer. It is said that Chinese invented Abacus around 4,000 years ago. It was a wooden rack which has metal rods with beads mounted on them. The beads were moved by the abacus operator according to some rules to perform arithmetic calculations. Abacus is still used in some countries like China, Russia and Japan.

                  <h2> How artificial intelligence is transforming the world </h2>
                  <p> Most of the people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17% said they were familiar with it. A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations. Despite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze dta, and use the resulting insights to ... <button onclick="window.location.href='https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-the-world/';">

                  <h2> Is the Evolution of Technology Inevitable? </h2>
                  <p> How do we end up with the technology we get? What role do we have in shaping it? To what extent was the future we live in inevitable, and to what extent did we shape it? To what extent should we actively seek to shape and to control it? As technologists we often focus our attention on our own project and on the creativity of our teams. But there are teams in other companies—and increasingly, in startups—that are developing technology along the same lines that we are. They see the trends and the opportunities that we do, and they make investments toward the same ends. There is, in a sense, a collective endeavor driven by a collective expectation of what will be. This expectation in a very real sense both drives the inventive process and assures that the new thing will be realized. Psychologists call this a self-fulfilling prophecy—the effect of a belief regarding the likelihood of an outcome and its realization in practice. Futurists like Ray Kurzweil have used data ... <button onclick="window.location.href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08956308.2021.1924525';">

                  <h2> This timeline charts the fast pace of tech transformation across centuries </h2>
                  <p> Technology can change the world in ways that are unimaginable, until they happen. Switching on an electric light would have been unimaginable for our medieval ancestors. In their childhood, our grandparents would have struggled to imagine a world connected by smartphones and the Internet. Similarly, it is hard for us to imagine the arrival of all those technologies that will fundamentally change the world we are used to. We can remind ourselves that our own future might look very different from the world today by looking back at how rapidly technology has changed our world in the past. That’s what this article is about. One insight I take away from this long-term perspective is how unusual our time is. Technological change was extremely slow in the past – the technologies that our ancestors got used to in their childhood were still central to their lives in their old age. In stark contrast to those days, we live in a time of extraordinarily fast technological change  ... <button onclick="window.location.href='https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/02/this-timeline-charts-the-fast-pace-of-tech-transformation-across-centuries/';">
